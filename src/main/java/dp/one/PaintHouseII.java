/*Paint House II
There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different.

You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x k cost matrix.

For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so onâ€¦ Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

 
Note:
All costs are positive integers.
